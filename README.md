# Javascript and JQuery Quiz

#### By: _Phil Curran / pecurran@hotmail.com_

#### This application helps users choose which programming language they should learn.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap (v5.1.3)
* JQuery (v3.6.0)  


## Description

Users choose which programming language they should learn based on completely unrelated personal preferences, like favorite desserts and movie villains.  This was intended to mimic (mock?) various Buzzfeed-styled quizzes. 

Users click on pictures to indicate their preferences for their 1) favorite dessert, 2) desired pet, 3) favorite movie villain, and 4) preferred questions.  A fifth question uses a form to gather the user's name and age so the response can be customized based on personal info.  


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Just clone and run with LiveServer!  

## Known Bugs

* Reload button is not currently working.  Don't know why.
